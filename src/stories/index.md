# Stories
So, you've made it to the *real* homepage of the site. Welcome in.

This is where I keep the various stories I spend my life creating.  
Pretty much everything I write is fiction of some kind, so if you're  
not into that, you might as well go find something else to spend  
your time on.

For your convinience, I've sorted out my writings into several    
categories, to make it easier to find what you're looking for.

*Oh, you're still here? I honestly thought you would leave once  
you saw that there was literally nothing here! As it turns out,  
I don't actually have anything written to put on this site, so  
it'll probably be empty for a little while. But I promise,  
**something** will be here eventually.*
