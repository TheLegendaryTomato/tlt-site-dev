# Hey.
Welcome to my crappy website. My guess is that you're here to read  
some [stories](stories/index.html). That's pretty much the only reason why this website  
exists. I try to keep it pretty simple around here.

If, by chance, you want to learn more about me, you're in luck. I  
have a whole [page](aboutme.html) dedicated to the subject. I don't know *why* someone  
would be so curious as to want to know about me, but  I figured I  
should include it. Who knows, it might be helpful to someone, somehow.
